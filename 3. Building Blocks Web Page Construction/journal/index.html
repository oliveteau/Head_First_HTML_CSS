            A great excursion through the mountains today...more information will be given in next step!
            Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way: 
        </p>

        <li>Walla Walla, WA</li>
        <li>Magic City, ID</li>

        <p>
            Very hot weather all day long, I am enjoying the sun at 12mph :). I won't get too dehydrated hopefully!
            I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
        </p>
        <blockquote>  
            Passing Cars, <br>
            When you can't see, <br>
            May get you, <br>
            a glimpse , <br>
            Of eternity.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            I definitely won't be passing any cars.
        </p>

        <h2>Monday 17th August</h2>
        <p>
            My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway,
            I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>cell phone</li>
            <li>ipod</li>
            <li>digital camera</li>
            <li>and a proteing bar</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Just the essentials.
            Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a thousands miles begins with one Segway.</q>
        </p>
